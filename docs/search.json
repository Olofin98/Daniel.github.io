    "text": "About Me\nHello! I’m Daniel Oluwafemi Olofin, a passionate and driven Master’s student in Mathematical Sciences with a concentration in Statistics at Georgia Southern University, USA. With a strong foundation in biostatistics and computational methodologies, I am deeply invested in leveraging data science, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to solve complex problems in healthcare, especially within clinical trials and oncology drug development.\n\n\nCurrent Academic Focus\nAt Georgia Southern, my academic journey is centered on biostatistical methods, computational biology, and AI applications in clinical research. I am particularly interested in the development and application of statistical machine learning techniques to improve drug discovery, personalized medicine, and oncology treatment outcomes. My coursework and research experiences continue to strengthen my ability to bridge theory with real-world health challenges.\n\n\nHobbies & Interests\nOutside of academics and research, I enjoy reading research papers, solving statistical puzzles, occasionally competing in academic quizzes, playing guitar, listening to music, and indulging in Mortal Kombat for some fun and relaxation."
