### About Me

Hello! I’m **Daniel Oluwafemi Olofin**, a passionate and driven Master’s student in **Mathematical Sciences (Statistics concentration)** at **Georgia Southern University**, USA. With a strong foundation in biostatistics and computational methodologies, I am deeply interested in leveraging data science, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to solve complex problems in healthcare, particularly within clinical trials and oncology drug development.

### Current Academic Focus

At Georgia Southern, my academic journey is centered on **biostatistical methods**, **computational biology**, and **AI applications in clinical research**. I am particularly interested in the development and application of **statistical machine learning techniques** to improve **drug discovery**, **personalized medicine**, and **oncology treatment outcomes**. My coursework and research experiences continue to strengthen my ability to bridge theory with real-world health challenges.

### Hobbies & Interests

Outside of academics and research, I enjoy reading research papers, solving statistical puzzles, occasionally competing in academic quizzes, playing guitar, listening to music, and indulging in Mortal Kombat for some fun and relaxation.
